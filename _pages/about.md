Hi!

I'm Ignasi. I was born in a small village on the Costa Brava and I've always liked building things. I have studied 
Telecommunication Engineering at the Polytechnic University of Catalonia (Barcelona) where I learned deep content about 
antennas and microwaves theory, signal processing techniques, statistics and stochastic processes, communication systems
 design and software engineering.

I started my professional career as a scholarship holder in the biomedical engineering laboratory at UPC, where I was 
introduced to the Android, Matlab and Research world.
Later on I decided to try the DevOps world to discover what was hidden behind all the code we usually write. I learned 
a lot about CI / CD pipelines and tools that are used to ensure a good quality of code.
Finally I went back to the programming sector where I could exploit all my knowledge of software engineering, design 
patterns, scalability, data structures, algorithms, etc.

I walk through the world with the idea of ​​making it better using technology. One of the things I like best is to make 
people's lives easier and better. The day I retire I would like to look back to the world and think that it is a better 
and more connected place than it used to be and that I have contributed with my small part to be able to achieve it.

I like to question "the way things have always been done", always looking for a point beyond mere programming in order
 to evaluate the situation or problem with which we find ourselves and look for the best possible scenario to solve it. 
 I like to replace what is old to make room for what is new.

Other interests I have and I would love to get involved in the professional level are machine learning, data science 
and robotics.
